# LWTAuth
Auth system for authenticating a user

The goal for this plugin is to allow the user to register thier mcpe name on a device and then be automatically reconized each time the user gets on that device therefore not causing the tremendous annoyance that SimpleAuth creates :D

I can't wait to see what becomes of this :D feel free to contribute
